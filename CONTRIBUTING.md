### 1. Suggest a gender identity to add

To add another gender to the list, you can either

- Create an [Issue](https://github.com/aimee-gm/gender-options/issues/new)
- Fork this repository and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/aimee-gm/gender-options/compare)

To suggest a new gender identity, please:

- Provide a suitable reference (e.g. wikipedia link) and short explanation of why it should be added
- Note any related gender identities that already exist
- Consider or recommend which list it should be added to

#### Notes:

- More information on the different types of list can be found in the [README](./README.md)
- The lists are **additive**, so the `basic` list items will be included in the `standard` list and all items will be included in the `extended` list

### 2. Make an enhancement

The package can also be extended by improving it's functionaity or documentation and contributions are welcome.
